<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Nathaniel, I live in Romania and would like to start a Web development career. I've always been interested in technology and how some things work,
for example..What's going on behind the interface of desktop, websites, phones and even cars. So i've decided to learn more about this and found out really interesting things.
I started learning about code and programming languages and creating of software operating systems, so i decided to make a career out of this and learn more about the IT world.
